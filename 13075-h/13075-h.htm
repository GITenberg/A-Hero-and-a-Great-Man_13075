With speech most savory<BR>
He boasts of great deeds.<p>

He is well respected.<BR>
He enjoys much recognition.<BR>

As greatness is a need<br>
This need is his fate.<br>
He is as great indeed,<br>
As his need to feel great.<p>

One day as he was walking,<br>
He happened to overhear<br>
Two girls that were talking.<br>
He turned his curious ear.<p>

As their words he overheard,<br>
He felt his aid was required.<br>
Always attracted to the spoken word<br>
To the girls he inquired,<p>

&ldquo;Why do you girls carry on<br>
In such a vociferous way?<br>
To you my attention is drawn<br>
Upon this beautiful day!!!&rdquo;<p>

And to him the him girls inquired,<br>
&ldquo;Where does the sun go at night?&rdquo;<br>
He knew an answer was required.<br>
But he knew not what was right.<p>

Where it goes, he could not say<br>
As he covertly looked about.<br>
Being a master of delay,<br>
He calmly searched for an out.<p>

A man was passing by<br>
And overheard this conversation.<br>
He thought he could supply,<br>
A goodly explanation.<p>

Details of this man are unknown<br>
For he lived a life withdrawn.<br>
He prefers to be quiet and alone.<br>
A common life he has forgone.<p>

You see, he was not like you and me.<br>
His methods were strange and new.<br>
A different world his eyes would see.<br>
A world in which others would have no clue.<p>

Despite his odd looks.<br>
He is more then he appears.<br>
He has read many books,<br>
Yet still wet behind the ears.<p>

Every culture to its own will conform.<br>
The mind of the crowd is a shallow creek.<br>
As this man was far from the norm,<br>
He was seen by the people as a freak.<p>

He values his peace.<br>
He is devoted to thought.<br>
This is his release.<br>
Nothing finer could be bought.<p>

As peace is a need<br>
This need is his fate.<br>
Attempting to run from greed,<br>
On simplicity he would concentrate.<p>

He never felt the peace<br>
That he needed to feel.<br>
He would never cease<br>
To search for what&rsquo;s real.<p>

If work was completed<br>
According to plan,<br>
It should not be repeated<br>
By a frustrated man.<p>

The only exception<br>
For such repetition<br>
Is the struggle for perfection,<br>
Or the folly of a politician.<p>

When he did a deed,<br>
When he found satisfaction,<br>
He could see no need<br>
For any further action.<p>

If nothing was there broken<br>
Or no deed to be done,<br>
No answer to be spoken,<br>
Then action was there none.<p>

If there is no disruption<br>
And everything seems in balance,<br>
Wasteful action is corruption<br>
Of the purest talents.<p>

A problem of complexity<br>
Needs a simple solution. <br>
A mind in perplexity<br>
Is lost in convolution.<p>

Now for the girls&rsquo; question,<br>
He felt he knew, really.<br>
He had a suggestion,<br>
And he offered it freely.<p>

&ldquo;A weary sun will hide<br>
To give a new night birth.<br>
The sun then goes to the other side<br>
Of our blessed Mother Earth.&rdquo;<p>

The problem seemed to be solved.<br>
The great man saw this.<br>
He went to get involved.<br>
For attention he could not miss.<p>

The freak&rsquo;s words had merit.<br>
An advantage had been gained,<br>
But the great man could not bear it.<br>
His status must be maintained.<p>

The freak&rsquo;s words he twisted<br>
With his eloquent speech.<br>
His charisma could not be resisted.<br>
It was he who would teach.<p>

He took the freak&rsquo;s idea<br>
And made it his own.<br>
No man would be right<br>
Except he alone.<p>

He devised his own story<br>
Using the freak&rsquo;s word.<br>
He would take the glory<br>
And make the freak seem absurd.<p>

&ldquo;He is not entirely correct.&rdquo;<br>
The great man thus began.<br>

To the Sun&rsquo;s warm beams<br>

For waves in the ocean<br>

The girls were amazed<br>
At this great display of speech.<br>
Into the great man&rsquo;s eyes they gazed<br>
As he proceeded to teach.<p>

A lesson he had taught<br>
Not unlike a story compiled<br>
From a borrowed thought<br>
With it&rsquo;s author left reviled.<p>

The freak was appalled<br>
Watching innocence beguiled.<br>
The girls were enthralled<br>
While the great man smiled.<p>

Who was being deceived?<br>
The freak felt some dismay.<br>
The great man the girls believed.<br>
And the freak just walked away.<p>

It seemed childish to contest.<br>
He saw no reason to fight.<br>
He thought best not to protest.<br>
Both of their answers were right.<p>

Over time the great man grew<br>
To earn a great man&rsquo;s reputation.<br>
His words would cause much ado<br>
And even some speculation.<p>

A few weeks quickly went by<br>
During which time came a threat.<br>
No rain had fallen from the sky,<br>
But the ground seemed to be wet.<p>

Water trickled like blood from a gash.<br>
Soon the streets turned to mud.<br>
People could not walk without a splash.<br>
There was fear that the town would flood.<p>

Slowly, this problem would develop.<br>
The water would continue to run.<br>
Eventually, the whole town it would envelop<br>
If something was not soon done.<p>

Water does not feel sorrow nor care<br>
Wherever it trickles and roams.<br>
The people were becoming more aware,<br>
For it was soon in their homes.<p>

To the great man the people went<br>
For some kind of solution.<br>
There must be a way to prevent<br>
Any further ground dilution.<p>

The great man promised thus,<br>
&ldquo;To you I can assure,<br>
For any problem threatening us<br>
For sure there is a cure!&rdquo;<p>

&ldquo;I will stop this silly little flood.<br>
Upon the great man you can rely.<br>
The ground may be covered in mud<br>
But, somewhere, must a solution lie!&rdquo;<p>

In his office the great man sat<br>
Staring at the water on the floor.<br>
He knew not how to deal with that,<br>
But he knew there would be more.<p>

Desperately trying to think of a plan<br>
He repeatedly read the plaque on the wall,<br>
&ldquo;Here is a Great Man<br>
He will save us all!&rdquo;<p>

The sparkling water had a sense of beauty<br>
As it reflected in the plaque.<br>
A painful reminder of his duty,<br>
A leader must never slack.<p>

So, eagerly, he donned his heavy boots,<br>
And ventured forth for a walk<br>
Through a series of muddy routes,<br>
For to the people he must talk.<p>

The great man noticed one man solitary<br>
As he trekked a turbid trail.<br>
To the woods with buckets he did carry<br>
In a struggling effort his home to bail.<p>

Though his face he could not see,<br>
He knew that this man to be clever and brave.<br>
He could not dwell on who it could be<br>
For the great man had a town to save.<p>

He thought of the people as his duty required<br>
To give them this instruction.<br>
By this sight he was inspired<br>
To save the town from destruction.<p>

&ldquo;Together we must pull!<br>
This I must accent!&rdquo;<br>
So each man scooped a bucket full<br>
And into the woods with the water they went.<p>

Soon this method had no effect.<br>
The water continued to rise.<br>
The people were beginning to suspect,<br>
This is not where the solution lies.<p>

The great man saw this method would fail<br>
But he knew he must not quit.<br>
Again he trekked the turbid trail<br>
To this problem he did commit.<p>

Then the great man saw a lone man dig<br>
A trench in which the water would drop.<br>
He dug it deep and he dug it big.<br>
Perhaps, in this trench, the water would stop!<p>

He thought of the people, as his duty required<br>
To give them this instruction.<br>
By this site he was again inspired<br>
To save the town from destruction.<p>

&ldquo;We must dig a great ditch<br>
In which the water will drop.<br>
Into this we all must pitch<br>
If the water we are to stop!<p>

A solution to this we must seek.<br>
Look to me in your time of need.<br>
Though the situation may now look bleak,<br>
We will succeed with my lead!&rdquo;<p>

Upon his shoulder, he felt a hand.<br>
It was, in fact, the odd man.<br>
The great man, at first, did not understand.<br>

&ldquo;You may be great and the people strong,<br>
But this won&rsquo;t stop the water&rsquo;s force.<br>
This will not work for very long.<br>
We must stop it at the source.&rdquo;<p>

The great man let out a great big laugh,<br>
And to the odd man he talked down.<br>
&ldquo;You think you can speak on the people&rsquo;s behalf?<br>
A great man must save this town!&rdquo;<br>

&ldquo;We all share the same concern.<br>
Your offer I do appreciate,<br>
However, to experience, we must now turn.<br>
This issue is too great.&rdquo;<p>

As the great man continued to give his speech<br>
The freak had turned and walked away.<br>
A solution soon someone must reach<br>
No matter what the great man would say.<p>

Soon the town will certainly be<br>
Just a huge pool of mud.<br>
It is not really hard to see<br>
That nothing is stopping this great flood.<p>

His mind was cloudy and his feet were muddy.<br>
While the great man talked and talked,<br>
The freak used this time to think and study,<br>
So in search of the source he walked.<p>

The freak followed the water alone.<br>
Deep into the woods he was led.<br>
There he found a slab of stone.<br>
On the stone it read,<p>

&ldquo;In the event of a flood<br>
This lesson should be learned<br>
Unless you like to live in mud,<br>

Below these words there was an arrow<br>
And it was pointing to the creek.<br>
The creek had begun to overflow.<br>
This was, no doubt, the source of the leak.<p>

The freak was indeed happy to learn<br>
How the flood had been produced.<br>
He found the valve and gave it a turn.<br>
And the water immediately was reduced.<p>

He went back up the muddy trail<br>
And told the people what he had done.<br>
But no one would believe his tale,<br>
Not a single, solitary one.<p>

Afraid of being deceived,<br>
The people showed only doubt,<br>
&ldquo;Why should he be believed?<br>
What is he all about?&rdquo;<p>

Skepticism and emotion<br>
Were sparked by the freak&rsquo;s word.<br>
His story caused quite a commotion,<br>
And the great man, of course, overheard.<br>

He said, &ldquo;I will solve this dispute.<br>
Whatever the problem, there must be a plan.<br>
Of the truth, we are in pursuit.<br>
A great problem requires a great man!&rdquo;<p>

&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a word, please come with me,&rdquo;<br>

The freak complied with his plea.<br>
To the great man&rsquo;s office he was led.<p>

Once in his office, he closed the door.<br>
He could not wait to ask,<br>
&ldquo;What did you do, I want to hear more,<br>
About how you pursued this task.&rdquo;<p>

As the freak began to describe<br>
The valve at the creek and slab of stone.<br>
The great man was not willing to subscribe<br>
To this story by a man who lives alone.<p>

The great man was in disbelief.<br>
He began to give the freak a speech.<br>
His talk was not short, nor was it brief.<br>
To the freak, a lesson he would teach.<p>

He told the freak about being great,<br>
And that by his word he would rule.<br>
Being a master at debate,<br>
He made the freak look like a fool.<p>

From the office the freak went,<br>
Stuck on the words the great man had said.<br>
He walked the path back home in resent,<br>
As the great man&rsquo;s voice he heard in his head.<p>

It&rsquo;s obvious that the town is his.<br>

&ldquo;Great man, bah...what a name!<br>

Into the forest, he marched in retaliation.<br>
He felt the need to settle the score.<br>
He could not bear this indignation.<br>
This town was not his home anymore.<p>

He found again the slab of stone.<br>
He found again the valve by the creek.<br>
Never before had he felt so alone.<br>
Revenge now did he seek.<p>

In his anger, he turned the valve back.<br>
The water began to overflow.<br>
He thought, for a moment, about this attack.<br>
Then he decided the people must know.<p>

On the way back, he felt some guilt.<br>
His conscience was big and his mind was young.<br>
Upon action his existence was built.<br>
Once back in town, he held his tongue.<p>

The town again began to flood.<br>
And the people again began to worry.<br>
The ground again had turned to mud.<br>
To their buckets again the people would hurry.<p>

But an effort repeated is a lesson taught.<br>

&ldquo;A man who knows power is a man who is wise.<br>

Who can find the answer that&rsquo;s little in size.<p>

Men who face danger, and do not cower.<p>

But they are heroes just the same.&rdquo;<p>

The girls who argued about the sun walked by.<br>
They offered him words so sweet,<br>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice man, there&rsquo;s no need to cry.<br>
He&rsquo;s a great man, and he can&rsquo;t be beat.&rdquo;<p>

The freak looked at the girls and smiled.<br>
He could see that a leader is all they need.<br>
It&rsquo;s noble to protect the innocence of a child.<br>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;He is a great man indeed.&rdquo;<p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
This particular work is one of the few copyrighted individual works
included with the permission of the copyright holder.  Information on

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
